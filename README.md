# Beat Box 

## Synopsis

BeatBox is not a box for musical beats. It is a box that helps you beat people up. It does not 
help with the easy part, though: the part where you wave your arms around dangerously, bruising 
and hurting another human being. It helps with the hard part: yelling in a manner calculated to 
frighten your opponent into submission.
